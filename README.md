# usage
### install packages first:  
`pip install websocket-client`

### using the actual commmand
`python3 chatroom.py (room) (username)`  
- room: the page to 'connect' to, clients must have this matching to talk to eachother
  - the global room number is `198`
- username: your username, obviously
  - please don't be obnoxious with this
